# PixelUi

PixelUi is a modern UI library designed to simplify the creation of beautiful and responsive user interfaces for e-commerce platforms. It provides a set of reusable and customizable components that you can seamlessly integrate into your React applications.

## Installation

To install the PixelUi library in your project, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @pixelui/core @pixelui/components @pixelui/themes
```
````

or

```bash
yarn add @pixelui/core @pixelui/components @pixelui/themes
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the PixelUi library, you can start using the components in your React application.

### Importing Components

You can import individual components from the library and use them in your application like this:

```javascript
import { Button, Card, Input } from "@pixelui/components";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click Me</Button>
      <Card>Some content inside the card</Card>
      <Input placeholder="Enter text" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Theming

PixelUi comes with predefined themes that you can use to style the components. To apply a theme to your application, you can use the `ThemeProvider` provided by the `@pixelui/themes` package:

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider } from "@pixelui/themes";
import { Button } from "@pixelui/components";
import { defaultTheme } from "@pixelui/themes";

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}>
      <Button>Click Me</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Customization

If you need to customize the themes or create your own themes, refer to the documentation in the `@pixelui/themes` package.
