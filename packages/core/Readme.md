In the "core" package of your "PixelUi" library, you can include the foundational code that provides essential utilities and common functionality used across your entire library. The "core" package typically contains code that is not directly related to user interface components but is crucial for their proper functioning. Here are some examples of what you might include in the "core" package:

1. **Helpers and Utilities:** Implement utility functions, helper classes, and helper components that are used across different parts of your library. These utilities can assist with tasks such as data manipulation, formatting, validation, and other common tasks.

2. **Theme Management:** If you're using theming to support multiple themes in your library, you can include theme management logic in the "core" package. This might include functions to switch between themes, load theme settings, and manage the active theme.

3. **Configuration Management:** Manage configuration settings for the library, such as global settings or customizable options that apply to multiple components. This can be particularly useful if you want to allow users to configure certain aspects of the library.

4. **Contexts and Providers:** Implement React context providers or custom hooks that provide state management and data sharing across your components. For instance, if you have a state management solution or global data that multiple components rely on, you can handle it in the "core" package.

5. **Localization and Internationalization:** If your library supports multiple languages, the "core" package can contain utilities and components related to localization and internationalization.

6. **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement error handling mechanisms and logging utilities that enable better debugging and tracking of issues within your library.

7. **Component HOCs (Higher-Order Components):** If you have higher-order components that enhance the behavior of other components, you can place them in the "core" package.

8. **Types and Interfaces:** Define common types and interfaces that are shared across your library components in the "core" package. This can help ensure consistent typing and improve code maintainability.

Remember, the "core" package should consist of code that is generic and reusable, providing the necessary infrastructure and functionality for other parts of your library to build upon. It should not contain UI components specific to any particular use case or domain. These UI components should be placed in separate packages like "components" or "themes."

By organizing your library this way, you create a clean separation of concerns and facilitate maintainability and extensibility as your library grows. Users can then selectively import the "core" package and any other specific packages (e.g., "components," "themes") they need to use in their projects.
